<p> 2a. The vr reality headset is a great example of computing innovation, not only does this device of various complex algorithms and high degree software which help important people to create, visionalize, and provides an experience that no one will forgot.This computational artifact was regularly used to help Doctor practice a multitude of different surgery procedures and a test for another different software to be create such as the high definition hologram.Overall the vr headset succeed in doing it’s main function and became a product that everyone can have.

2b. For starters creating an algorithm for the gyroscope was not easy. Determining weight on a headset is not that easy you have to solve the many problem such as the sensors, the weight scale that check where your head is moving, and lastly a connection between the controller and there sensors.once you figure out this process we proceed with creating an environment that you can interact with.all of this meanwhile you are talking to different people who are also creating such environment for help and support.

2c.The most beneficial effect of the vr headset is the accessibility to create environment, scenarios, and ideas such as a building that hasn’t even been made yet by using its blueprints you can see what the house would look like and determine if you wanted to change anything.Similar another great use of the vr headset and one of the most important is the use of creating the scenario for a doctor so that they can practice with. The negative effect of the vr headset is like other devices it can be a distraction to anyone using it causing a lack of knowledge of time that can cause a great deal of problems. The next and the last problem is the possibility of lack of awareness to your surroundings that could cause accidents to be specific deaths if condition met.

2d.Well the data that my innovation uses is a combination of weighting, the field algorithm  that determines whether an object is close by to the person or far away.By inputting these condition you can create a environment that is totally interactive  with a set of values that are 1s and zeros.the data storage concern with this devices is the ability to store such data you see the vr headset is a internet linking devices like many other but this one is very vulnerable you cyber attacks currently in development to security for the headset.
